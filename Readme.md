# invalid

  Validate an object against a schema. This is the schema validation library you actually wanted.

  This library is only responsible for type-checking and leaves the requires, filtering, etc. to other libraries.

## install

    npm install invalid

## Example

```js
var Settings = {
  view: String,
  theme: String,
  facebook: Object
}

var schema = {
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  created: Date,
  settings: Settings,
  tasks: [String],
  langs: Array
};

var obj = {
  name: 'matt',
  age: 25,
  created: new Date(),
  settings: {
    view: 'hi',
    theme: 'blue',
    facebook: true
  },
  tasks: [4],
  langs: [3, 'hi']
};

/**
 * Validate
 */

invalid(obj, schema)
// [TypeError: settings.facebook: true is not a object, tasks[0]: "hi" is not a number]

/**
 * Currying
 */

var errors = invalid(schema);
errors(obj)
// [TypeError: settings.facebook: true is not a object, tasks[0]: "hi" is not a number]

obj.settings.facebook = {};
tasks[0] = 5;
errors(obj) // false
```

## API

### `invalid(obj, schema) => boolean|typeerror`

Validate `obj` against a `schema`. If the object is invalid, `invalid` will return an error containing all the issues. If the object is valid, `invalid` will return `false`.

### `invalid(schema) => function`

If you just pass a schema in, you will get a function back that you can use to validate against any number of objects.

## Object Types

Most of the types are self-explanatory, but here are a few unique types:

### Objects

```
Object: Object containing values of any type
Settings: Setting `object` that is recursively enforced by `invalid`
```

### Arrays

```js
[String]: Array of Strings
[Number]: Array of Numbers
[Settings]: Array of `Setting` objects that is recursively enforced by `invalid`.
...
Array: Array containing any type of value
```
